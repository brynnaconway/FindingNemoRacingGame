# Finding Nemo Race Game
### Brynna Conway and Leah Plofchan

1. Instructions on How To Run The Game
------------------------------------------
    This is a two player game that allows for an exciting competition over a
    network.  In order to begin the game, one user will decide to be the host
    and the other user will act as the client.  Both scripts needs to be run on
    "ash.campus.nd.edu".  The host user will start his/her game with the command
    "python host.py" and the client user will start his/her game with the
    command "python client.py".  Once both users have connected, each will have
    a pop-up window appear with the game ready to be played.

2. How to Start the Game
----------------------------
    Once both windows appear, it is time to begin the race! Inspired by Disney
    Pixar's Finding Nemo, 
    the objective of the game is to beat your opponent in
    finding your way home.  Both players will be the character Nemo, but you
    will always see your gamespace screen as the top screen on the window.  You
    will be able to see your opponent's progress in the bottom gamespace.  

    In order to move Nemo, you will use the arrow keys.  Nemo can move up, down,
    and right against the persistent and constant current that is moving him
    left.  

3. Game Features
-----------------
    Along the way to find home, your character Nemo will face a series of
    obstacles/boosters.  These obstacles will be moving up and down in the
    direct path towards home.  If you hit the jellyfish, you will freeze for
    approximately half a second.  If you hit the shark, you will be forced to start over at
    the left edge of the screen.  If you swim too close to the bottom near the reef, your
    speed will significantly decrease.  However, if you manage to hit Crush, the
    turtle, you will get a speed boost that will zoom you forward.  You are
    continually moving along and avoiding obstacles.  Eventually, if you are
    successful, you will reach Marlin and Dory and have made it home. Whichever
    user reaches Marlin and Dory first will win. Once a player has won, a
    message will appear on their screen and then they can close the screen to
    end the game.  The loser will have a losing message appear on their screen.
    
Enjoy!
